I finished my undergrad at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with an aditional year of courses from the Mathematics Department. During my time at the University I participated in several international Mathematics Competition wining multiple awards. I was also a teaching assistant for courses that prepare the University teams for those competitions with the supervision of Associate Professor [Romanos Diogenes Malikiosis](https://sites.google.com/site/romanosdiogenesmalikiosis/).
